While cookies can enhance the user experience by remembering login credentials and site preferences, they also raise concerns about user privacy. In India, the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, govern the collection and handling of sensitive personal data. These rules require organizations to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting data through cookies. GDPR, on the other hand, places strict requirements on cookie usage in the European Union. It mandates that websites must inform users about the types of cookies used and obtain their consent before setting non-essential cookies. This ensures that users have control over their online data and can make informed decisions about their privacy. Understanding the intersection of cookie usage and privacy laws is crucial for organizations operating globally, as they must navigate a complex regulatory landscape to protect user data while providing personalized online experiences.\""
